# myAllocator-MemoryPool
Final project for Oriented Object Programming

Requirements

1. Implement your own memory allocator for STL vector.
2. The allocator should optimize the memory allocation speed using memory pool.
3. The allocator should support arbitrary memory size allocation request.

How to Test Your Allocator

Basically, you should:

1. Create more than ten thousand vectors with different number of elements.

2. Pick up 1000 random vectors and resize the vectors with random sizes.

3. Release all the vectors.
